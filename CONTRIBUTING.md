## How to contribute to Pupilfirst

### Did you find a bug?

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Pupilfirst**. Instead, please send [our
  development team an email](mailto:dev@pupilfirst.com) detailing the security issue.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
  [Issues](https://github.com/SVdotCO/pupilfirst/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
  [open a new one](https://github.com/SVdotCO/pupilfirst/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear
  description**, and as much relevant information as possible.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please make sure that your code is properly formatted. For Ruby code, that usually means following
  the settings in `.editorconfig` and making sure that Rubocop doesn't complain. For ReasonML, it's simpler - just make
  sure that your development environment is set up correctly so that `refmt` auto-formats code.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in the issues list, so that it can be discussed.

* If you wish to start writing code, please make sure that you get the go-ahead from someone on the Pupilfirst team.

### Do you have questions about the source code?

Send [the developer group an email](mailto:dev@pupilfirst.com)!

Thank you for your interest!
